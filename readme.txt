== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I customize my list and new default sources are added, will my list be updated? =

Future versions are planned with improved support for appending to default versus replacing it with your own list.

= What happens to the evil spammers? =

Their requests are intentionally blocked from continuing to load any WordPress code and get directed away from your site. If they have a puppy, it cries.
