== Description ==

Custom Referral Spam Blocker gives you the control to ensure that dishonest referral sources are blocked from Google Analytics.

We provide a strong default set of spam referral sources and block them for you.  Referrers can quickly be added in moments using the WordPress Dashboard.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I customize my list and new default sources are added, will my list be updated? =

Future versions are planned with improved support for appending to default versus replacing it with your own list.

= What happens to the evil spammers? =

Their requests are intentionally blocked from continuing to load any WordPress code and get directed away from your site. If they have a puppy, it cries.
